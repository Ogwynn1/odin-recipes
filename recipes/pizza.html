    <h2>How to make a cheese pizza</h2>
    <p>Nothing beats a slice of classic cheese pizza, especially when made with fresh ingredients.</p>
    <p>Follow along with this short guide and easy steps to make the ultimate cheese pizza.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>For the base</strong></p>
        <li>300g strong bread flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp/sachet instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling</li>

        <p><strong>For the tomato sauce</strong></p>
        <li>100ml passata</li>
        <li>handful of fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, crushed/grated</li>

        <p><strong>For the topping</strong></p>
        <li>125g ball of mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>handful of grated or shaved parmesan</li>
        <li>handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>

        <p><strong>To finish</strong></p>
        <li>handful of basil leaves</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <li><em>Make the base:</em> Sift the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</li>
        <p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <li><em>Make the Sauce:</em> Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</li>
        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <li><em>Roll out the dough:</em> You’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <li><em>Top and Bake:</em> Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
